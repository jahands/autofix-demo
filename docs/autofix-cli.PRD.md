# autofix-cli PRD

## Product Overview

The autofix-cli is a specialized command-line tool designed to automate the conversion of Cloudflare Pages projects to Cloudflare Workers. It enables AI agents to make deterministic, predictable changes to project configurations, reducing the likelihood of deployment failures and streamlining the migration process.

## Problem Statement

Developers attempting to deploy applications to Cloudflare Workers often encounter deployment failures due to missing or incorrect configuration files (e.g., wrangler.jsonc). This creates friction in the deployment process and requires manual intervention to resolve configuration issues.

## Target Users

- **Primary**: AI migration agents that automate Pages-to-Workers conversions
- **Secondary**: Internal Cloudflare systems that facilitate automated migrations

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: AI-Driven Migration

An AI agent receives a user request to migrate a Cloudflare Pages project to Workers. The agent:

1. Clones the repository
2. Invokes autofix-cli with appropriate migration flags
3. Reviews the CLI output for any unresolved issues
4. Creates a pull request with the necessary changes

### Success Metrics

- **Conversion Success Rate**: Percentage of projects successfully converted without manual intervention
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Percentage of converted projects that deploy successfully to Workers
- **Error Resolution Time**: Time saved by providing clear, actionable error messages to AI agents

## Core Features

### 1. Framework-Specific Migration Support

Support for converting the following frameworks from Pages to Workers:

- **Priority 1**: Astro SSG (Static Site Generation)
- **Priority 2**: Astro SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- **Priority 3**: Remix
- **Priority 4**: Svelte

### 2. Configuration Management

- **wrangler.jsonc Creation/Updates**: Generate or modify wrangler configuration files with appropriate settings for Workers deployment
- **Package.json Script Updates**: Add necessary build and deployment scripts, including `wrangler pages functions builds` for frameworks utilizing the Pages `functions/` directory
- **Framework-Specific Configurations**: Handle unique requirements for each supported framework

### 3. AI-Optimized Output

- **Structured Reporting**: Provide clear, parseable output describing actions taken and issues encountered
- **Exit Code Management**: Use exit codes to indicate success/failure states
- **Actionable Error Messages**: When issues cannot be automatically resolved, provide specific guidance for manual intervention

### 4. Validation and Verification

- **Configuration Validation**: Verify that generated configurations are syntactically correct
- **Build Testing**: Attempt to build the project to validate conversion success (where feasible)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle cases where validation cannot be performed (e.g., missing environment variables)

## User Experience

### Command Interface

The CLI will be invoked by AI agents using:

```bash
npx -y autofix-cli@latest migrate-to-workers --framework [framework] [additional-flags]
```

### Output Format

The CLI will provide:

- **Success Summary**: List of files modified and configurations added
- **Warning Messages**: Non-blocking issues that may require attention
- **Error Details**: Specific problems that prevented successful conversion
- **Next Steps**: Recommendations for manual intervention when needed

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Failures**: When automatic conversion is not possible, provide detailed explanations
- **Partial Success**: Report successful changes even when some aspects fail
- **Recovery Guidance**: Offer specific steps for resolving unresolved issues

## Technical Requirements

### Input Requirements

- **Framework Specification**: AI agent must explicitly specify the framework being migrated
- **Project Detection**: CLI should validate that the target project matches the specified framework
- **Configuration Discovery**: Automatically detect existing configurations and build processes

### Output Requirements

- **Machine-Readable Output**: Format optimized for AI agent consumption
- **Human-Readable Logging**: Clear explanations of actions taken
- **Exit Code Standards**: Consistent exit codes for different failure scenarios

### Validation Requirements

- **Pre-Migration Checks**: Verify project structure and dependencies
- **Post-Migration Validation**: Confirm generated configurations are valid
- **Build Verification**: Test project builds where possible

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success

- Successfully converts supported frameworks from Pages to Workers configuration
- Generates valid wrangler.jsonc files for target frameworks
- Updates package.json scripts appropriately for Workers deployment
- Provides clear feedback on conversion status and any issues

### Quality Success

- Conversion success rate > 90% for supported frameworks
- Generated configurations result in successful Workers deployments > 85% of the time
- Clear, actionable error messages for failed conversions
- Minimal false positives in framework detection

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility

The CLI should be designed to easily support additional frameworks and migration types as the product evolves.

### Integration Points

Consider how the CLI will integrate with:

- Cloudflare Dashboard migration workflows
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Developer tooling ecosystems

### Observability

Track CLI usage patterns, success rates, and common failure modes to inform product improvements.
